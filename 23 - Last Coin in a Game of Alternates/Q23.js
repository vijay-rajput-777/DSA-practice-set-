// Given an array integer arr[] , representing the values of coins arranged in a row.

// Two players play a game by picking coins alternately.
// At each turn, a player can pick a coin from either the beginning or the end of the array. Both players follow a greedy strategy, i.e., they always pick the coin with the maximum value among the two available ends.
// The game continues until only one coin remains.
// Find the value of the last remaining coin.

// Examples:

// Input : arr[] = [5, 3, 1, 6, 9]
// Output : 1
// Explanation:
// Players always pick the larger coin from the two ends.
// Pick 9, remaining array: [5, 3, 1, 6]
// Pick 6, remaining array: [5, 3, 1]
// Pick 5, remaining array: [3, 1]
// Pick 3, remaining array: [1]
// Final Output: 1
