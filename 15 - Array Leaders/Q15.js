// You are given an array arr of positive integers. Your task is to find all the leaders in the array. An element is considered a leader if it is greater than or equal to all elements to its right. The rightmost element is always a leader.

// Examples:

// Input: arr = [16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2]
// Output: [17, 5, 2]
// Explanation: Note that there is nothing greater on the right side of 17, 5 and, 2.
// Input: arr = [10, 4, 2, 4, 1]
// Output: [10, 4, 4, 1]
// Explanation: Note that both of the 4s are in output, as to be a leader an equal element is also allowed on the right. side
